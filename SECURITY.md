# Reporting Security Issues

The Echo team takes security errors at Echojs-lib seriously. We appreciate your efforts and will make every effort to recognize your contribution.

To report a security issue, write [security@echo-dev.io](mailto:security@echo-dev.io) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject.

We will send you a response with the following steps. After the initial response to your report,
the our team will inform you of the progress towards the correction and the full announcement
and may request additional information or recommendations.

Report security errors in third-party modules to an employee or team serving the module.
You can also report a vulnerability through [this page](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report).
